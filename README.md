## Day 1: April 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Completed 4 modules/labs on Learn. Going through Authentication again in Rails.

**Thoughts**:
This is the second time I've gone through this section of Rails. Because of how
long this Rails section has taken me to complete my project, I thought it would
be a good idea to back over things and get a better understanding of things while
I plan out my project.
