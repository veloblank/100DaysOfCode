## Day 1: April 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Completed 4 modules/labs on Learn. Going through Authentication again in Rails.

**Thoughts:**
This is the second time I've gone through this section of Rails. Because of how
long this Rails section has taken me to complete my project, I thought it would
be a good idea to back over things and get a better understanding of things while
I plan out my project.

## Day 2: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Started working through Rails book by Michael Hartl. I intend to build his 3
projects in the book. Also continued on Authentication section of Learn
curriculum.

**Thoughts:**
I really like the Hartl book. The coding is clean and he seems to realize the
importance of using/creating tests to guide the coding. While this is a little
step away from the curriculum and my overall goal of completing my Rails project
in the next 2 weeks, it will help round out my Rails learning.

## Day 3-4: April 16, 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Continued reading the Hartl Rails e-book. Worked on 5 labs and 6 modules of
Learn curriculum in the new v7 version of the curriculum. Fixed an issue with
Rails and rvm that was affecting productivity. Updated some gems in my Sinatra
project that was preventing the Puma server from starting using the Shotgun
gem.

**Thoughts:**
The labs were some busy work since I didn't really need to jump into the v7 of
the Flatiron curriculum, but at this point it's important for me to code every
day and keep the momentum going. I re-learned some things about Git and I got
to troubleshoot some Ubuntu-specific issues affecting my Ruby installation.
