## Day 1: April 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Completed 4 modules/labs on Learn. Going through Authentication again in Rails.

**Thoughts:**
This is the second time I've gone through this section of Rails. Because of how
long this Rails section has taken me to complete my project, I thought it would
be a good idea to back over things and get a better understanding of things while
I plan out my project.

## Day 2: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Started working through Rails book by Michael Hartl. I intend to build his 3
projects in the book. Also continued on Authentication section of Learn
curriculum.

**Thoughts:**
I really like the Hartl book. The coding is clean and he seems to realize the
importance of using/creating tests to guide the coding. While this is a little
step away from the curriculum and my overall goal of completing my Rails project
in the next 2 weeks, it will help round out my Rails learning.
