# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1: November 18, 2019 (R1D1)

**Today's Progress**
Spent a large chunk of time working on Flatiron curriculum in Redux. So far I've completed 7 labs in the Redux section.

**Thoughts**
This is my 2nd attempt at Redux, and things are coming together much better this time. I have a better understanding of JavaScript and some of the ES6 features that have made this time around in Redux actually enjoyable. I'm not sure how confident the developer community is with Redux anymore, given that Dan Abramov has apoligized somewhat for the complexity and the boilerplated-ness of it all. In any case, I'm excited to be back on the train.

## Days 2-12: November 19-30, 2019 (R1D1)

**Today's Progress**
Continuing to go through the Flatiron curriculum as well as working on my JS project. November 30 was good for my project.

**Thoughts**
My projects always could use a little better planning. My file structures are pretty poor going into the project, and I waste a lot of time coding and then dealing with structures, import and export of the modules, etc. I will do better on future projects.
